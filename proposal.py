'''What's your project?
A: I'm making a game using pygame. The sprite would move along the screen and players would naviage an obstacle
course and move game boards. 

What is your first major milestone?
A: My first major milestone will be figuring out how to change gameboards as the sprite goes off the x graph

What do you not know that you will need to learn?
A: I need to learn the proper syntax, and I need to learn how to make a sprite move accross the page.

In what ways is your project too ambitious?
A: If I tried to add a ton of obstacles and make the game more complex it could be too ambitious

In what ways is it possibly not ambitious enough?
A: I think I can challenge myself to make the obstacles a little more sophistacted, possibly have moving
objects on the screen trying to block the sprite from moving on.

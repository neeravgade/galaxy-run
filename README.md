GALAXY RUN README

Introduction
Galaxy Run is a game I created using the template from the maze runner game linked below. Basically, the game involves a sprite travelling in outerspace, and the objective is to collect as many coins as possible before the 60 second time limit runs out. The walls and ability to travel through different rooms make the game a little more challenging. 

First and foremost, I followed the maze runner tutorial, which basically showed me how to make a sprite move, and collide with walls on the pygame screen. It also had the functions to cycle through 3 rooms. I used this basic gameplay and then modified it drastically. 
The most challenging aspect of this project was making a function and class for collecting coins. However, I realized I can use a lot of the same syntax as the wall Class. After figuring out how to make coins display on the screen, I focused on a moving background, sound effects, and displaying the score in the upper left hand corner of the game screen.
